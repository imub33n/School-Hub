# School-Hub
## FYP project
### __School-Hub__ will be a centralized system for schools. 
School-Hub will be a platform where schools can share their course curriculum, syllabus, study plans and infrastructures etc. Schools will benefit by reviewing other schools study plans, course curriculum, infra-structures etc. School-Hub will be a platform where students and teachers from schools can communicate, share knowledge, and help each other. Teachers, Students and Parents each will have a timeline/feed where they can post articles or images, view posts by other users, get notification, edit account details, and access other features (search schools, share posts etc.). 


School-Hub will help parents to find a school for their children easily and efficiently. School-Hub will provide the complete details and statistics of schools (Textual Information and Graphical Representations). Users (Parents, Teachers, Students) can search for a school by simple search and filter or by looking for schools on maps.
